# NoiseTagging

This repository is a snapshot of the Noise-Tagging project as carried out at the Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It involves a brain computer interface (BCI) that utilizes code-modulated visual evoked potentials (cVEP) to decoding what a user is attending to (e.g., in a visual matrix speller) from brain activity. The code in this repository belong directly to the research article as listed below.
